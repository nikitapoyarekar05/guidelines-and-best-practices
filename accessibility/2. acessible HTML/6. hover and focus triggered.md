# Hover-Triggered and Focus-Triggered Content
Understand the challenges of hover-triggered and focus-triggered content and learn alternatives and workarounds.

One of the many interaction patterns - tooltips, spoiler-covered text or images.

But hover-triggered content is just not an accessible pattern.

Our best bet is to use a different approach or provide an alternate source, in addition to the hover-triggered content, to communicate the same information

## Limitations of hover-dependent interactions
Obvious concern: Not everyone use a mouse, and without a mouse, hover based interactions are difficult to trigger. 
- This means that not only will this content be inaccessible for people using keyboard navigation or alternative navigation inputs, but it will also be inaccessible for people on touch-based devices (which are also incapable of hovering).
- Those who can use mouse, they still need fine motor skills to hover over the target
- People having low vision might struggle with smaller targets

Overall, this is a user interface pattern that requires an incredibly specific type of interaction and therefore severely limits the percentage of our user base who will be able to perform this action without difficulty.

## Non-intuitive hover interactions
Non-intuitive hover interactions are UI patterns where important information appears only when hovering — with no clear cue that it exists.

This breaks;
1. Predictability - If users can’t tell that something will happen when they hover, they can’t find that information on purpose.
Ex. A chart where hovering over bars shows numbers. Many users miss information completely.

2. Excludes keyboard and touch users, and hides content from assistive technologies - Keyboard-only users can’t “hover” (They navigate with Tab, not a mouse). Touchscreen users (phones, tablets) can’t hover either (The content simply never appears). Screen reader users might not even know hover-triggered content is there.
    - This violates **WCAG 1.4.13 – Content on Hover or Focus**, which says: Hover-triggered content must be dismissible, hoverable, and persistent long enough to be read.

## Hover-activated disruption
Even sighted mouse users can be frustrated if hover content appears suddenly, blocks other text, or disappears too quickly. 

## Recognizable Patterns (Partially Okay)

Some hover patterns are more predictable because users expect them:
- A question mark icon (❓) next to a label → users often know it’s a tooltip.
- A “ⓘ info” icon → recognizable indicator.

These work because users get a visual cue that “extra info” exists.

## Accessible hover-based content
Seriously **iterate and consider** whether hover-triggered content is something that is genuinely required in our application or website. 

Some ways to make hover-based content more accessible:
- Add Dual trigger. Use focusable triggers (button, a, etc.), not just hover for content
- Use WAI-ARIA. Add tabIndex to ? or info icon to consider it under natural focus. 
- Dismiss content with ESC key
