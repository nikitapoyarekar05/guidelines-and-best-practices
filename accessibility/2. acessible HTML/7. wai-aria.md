# WAI-ARIA
Gain insight into the purpose of WAI-ARIA attributes and learn when it is appropriate, or not, to incorporate them into your website or application.

WAI-ARIA stands for **“Web Accessibility Initiative—Accessible Rich Internet Applications"**

Simply referred as **ARIA attributes**

They exist so that developers can manually attach information about the role, name, description, state, and interaction options to non-semantic elements that don’t have that information naturally associated with them.

This allows us to create complex widgets and custom tools in an accessible way.

## Utilizing ARIA live for content updates
Aria-live tells screen readers to monitor a section of the page for changes and automatically announce updates to the user, without moving focus
- Used for loading dynamic content
- It can be either polite or assertive or off
    - off: Default, which doesn’t announce updates
    - polite: Waits until the user is idle before announcing
        - Non-urgent updates (status messages, confirmations).
    - assertive: Interrupts current speech immediately to announce
        - Urgent updates (errors, warnings).

Unless the announcement is truly immediate and urgent, polite should always be what we reach for.

## ARIA labels in non-text elements
Used for Button that uses an icon to identify it but no text. 
- A screen reader or other assistive technology will normally use the text inside a ```<button>``` tag to identify the button. Therefore icon buttons can be inaccessible. In this case, we should include aria-label to give our element an accessible name.

## Assigning ARIA roles to non-semantic elements
We don't have an in built HTML element to create a banner. In that case, you can use any HTML element and assign an aria-role to it as banner. 

Giving this custom element/widget a role helps assistive technologies figure out where it fits into our layout and present it correctly to our users. Banners don’t have a semantic HTML element, so we can define one using ARIA.

Understanding ARIA attributes is pivotal for enhancing web accessibility. HTML5’s semantic elements reduce ARIA necessity but don’t eliminate its significance. Proper ARIA usage ensures accessibility in complex web interactions and custom UI elements.
