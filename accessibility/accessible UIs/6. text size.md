# Text size
Learn the guidelines for choosing and setting text size.

## WCAG text size requirements
Recommended size for body - 16px, default browser size 1 em


## Adjusting text
WCAG standards require users to be allowed to resize text up to 200% (twice the original width and height) without losing any content or functionality on the page

## Custom text size adjustment settings
1. Built-in text adjustments: It will allow a user to increase the size of the font without affecting the other elements on the page. 
    - Use JS and simply switch classes attached to the elements
    - To scale font size globally, define all text using rem, tie the root font size (or a wrapper div) to a user-adjustable scaling factor, and update it dynamically, ensuring everything reflows correctly and meets WCAG 1.4.4

## Rem font sizes
The rem units measure size relative to the font size of the element
- Set the base size of 16px set as 1em unit, and everything else in rem units. In that case, 2rem is twice the size of the root font

## Avoid absolute values - Pixels
We can also use em units, percentages, or other relative units to define our text sizes, but using absolute values (such as pixels) isn't recommended. They don’t scale as well and can present a real struggle when it comes to accessibility.

**Avoid these hard values almost no matter what we’re defining: widths, heights, font sizes**

## Tips for True Accessibility
- Always use relative units (rem, em, %) and not px.
- Keep text responsive and reflowable (for WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow).
- Store user’s font preference in localStorage so it persists.
- Test scaling up to 200% layout should still work and be readable.
