# Managing multiple color themes
Learn about creating accessible themes, including dark mode, custom themes, and user-customizable themes.

Common themes: Light and Dark

## Remember
1. Every theme must be accessible.
2. Avoid adapting existing themes - When your app has multiple themes, don’t treat one as the “main” and others as quick.variations. Each theme should be designed and tested with equal care as if it’s a standalone product
3. Add Dark mode - helpful for people who struggle with migraines, light sensitivity, eye strain.
4. Achieve color contrast with dark mode themes - try exploring a dark mode palette with a base color that isn’t black or grey.
5. High-contrast themes - Use pure black background color (as opposed to the more standard dark grey) and then neon colors for the rest of the palette.
6. User customizable themes - Allow users is to fully customize the theme colors. **Huge a11y win** for users coz everything is according to their choice.


## KEEP IN MIND
As always, it’s good to keep in mind that the web in its most basic state (vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS) is built to be inherently accessible. Most accessibility problems happen when we, the developers, start to over-complicate or use elements in ways they were not originally intended. Often, the best thing we can do to support accessibility is to stay out of the way.
