# Alternate Presentations of Information - Alt text
Understand the importance of alt text and learn how to write it effectively.

- The applicable WCAG guideline, Success Criteria 1.1.1 (non-text content), addresses the accessibility requirements for content that isn’t text-based. 
- This criterion states that any non-text content we serve to our users is also accompanied by text that serves the same purpose

## Alt text: Image accessibility improvement
Add a text description or summary of the content displayed in the image. 
- Done via alt text (short for alternative text), which is added directly to the `<img>` tag. 
- For more complex or in-depth images, such as detailed data visualizations, a text summary can be a better option.

How it helps?
- tells a visually impaired user what’s being shown in the picture
- users who have a slow internet connection or limited data, alt text can be immensely helpful
- If you’ve ever opened an email where the images haven’t been downloaded yet, or the image downloads were blocked for safety, then you’ve seen alt text in action.

## Effective alt text
- **Describing visual media with alt text:** Unless the image is of a piece of art, we don’t need to include the medium i.e. we don’t have to say “image of” or “photo of” at the beginning of our descriptions. A photograph is considered to be the default medium, so “photo of” is implied information. Ex. People moving in front of classical paintings in an art museum. The people are blurred to indicate motion.
    - The only time we need to call out the medium will be for illustrations, paintings, murals, or other works of art. 
    - Basically, anytime we diverge from that default of photography.
    - We only need to include information about the medium in our alt text when we’re describing works of art or other nonstandard photographs

- **Blank alt text:** Blank alt text should only be used when the image is a decorative image. They do not convey any information to the users, and that's why alt text for these should be blank.
    - That tells assistive technology: “This image exists, but it’s decorative, so skip it.”
    - Omitting a decorative image from the accessibility tree reduces distraction and improves the user’s screen reader experience.

- **Be detailed:** A photo is worth a thousand words, so we should ensure that we’re not using just one or two to try and describe a whole image.
    - The alt text alt="Cake" is significantly less helpful than alt="A chocolate cake with candles, in front of a small girl wearing a birthday hat and a pink dress."
    - While coming up with our description, we have to think about why we included the image in the first place. What parts of the image reinforce the point we’re making or provide an example? 
    - Make sure to include and highlight aspects of the image that help the user understand why it’s relevant in this situation.

- **Adding relevant description:** It’s generally a bad practice to use images of text. 
    -  Any image that is only text should just be written directly using the appropriate heading or paragraph tags rather than embedded into an image.
    - Occasionally, images happen to have relevant text included as part of a larger scene, such as a photo of a sign or a book title. In those cases, we need to include all of the photo text in the alt text so our users don’t miss out on the content.

- **Managing groups of images for accessibility:** Whenever we’re dealing with a situation in which we have a group of images that are intended to all work together to convey a single idea or piece of information, the alt text for one image should communicate the information for the entire group.
    -  The user shouldn’t have to engage with the alt text for four or five images just to piece together the high-level concept that fully-sighted users would have understood at a glance.

- **Alt text for icons:** It’s common practice to use icons instead of text for buttons, especially in situations where we’re trying to save space, such as toolbars and menus. 
    - In these cases, we need to describe the function of the link or button rather than the icon itself. Ex. If we have a button that uses an icon of a floppy disk to indicate the save function, then we want our alt text to say “Save,” not “Vector illustration of a 3.5-inch floppy disk.”


In all of this, it’s crucial to remember that we’re trying to capture the overall experience for our users. When we give them information that’s not relevant or necessary, we can create a distraction. More isn’t always more when it comes to descriptive text! We want to include enough to properly communicate the experience, but not so much that we’re slowing our users down by making them parse through unnecessary information that our other users don’t have to deal with.
