# Text Summaries
Learn why the text summaries enhance accessibility by providing alternative descriptions for visual content, benefiting diverse user needs.

Alt text can’t always be the answer to all of our visual content accessibility challenges, like in the following cases: 
- A chart or data visualization: The image we’re describing will be an SVG or canvas element, so the alt attribute (which is only found as part of img tags) simply isn’t available.
- Need to describe a series of images that are all working together to portray a single idea.
- We’re trying to capture the greater context of a table of data or some kind of interactive widget

In all of these cases, what we’re looking for is an alternative to alt text that still allows us to summarize and capture inaccessible content for our users who aren’t able to fully perceive it in its native state. The answer to our problems is the **text summary**.

## Alt text vs. text summaries

| Alt Text                                                               | Text Summaries                                                      |
| -----------------------------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------|
| An attribute of the img tag                                            | Can use a variety of tags, including p, title, figcaption, and more |
| Specifically for describing images                                     | Can be used to describe or summarize any content                    |
| Not normally seen in the UI (unless the image fails to load) or higher | Always visible in the UI                                            |
| Intended primarily for screen readers or higher                        | Intended to add context and detail for the benefit of all users     |

## Applications for text summaries
1. Infographics, charts, and data visualizations - use the native HTML figure and figcaption tags
2. Complex text - add abstract of a scientific paper

## Creating a high-quality text summary
- Present the main takeaway of the content, then add a few sentences that explain how or why that conclusion was made.
- This shouldn’t be longer than a paragraph, although it could be as short as one or two sentences if there’s not a lot of information to summarize.

## Understanding risks and challenges - some common pitfalls
- Maintain an appropriate tone:
    - Avoid sounding patronizing or talking down to readers.
    - Assume the audience is capable and intelligent, even if they’re new to the topic.

- Use clear, accessible language:
    - Avoid jargon, acronyms, and industry-specific terms.
    - If a technical term is necessary, briefly define it in simple words.

- Keep summaries concise and focused:
    - Don’t try to include every detail or data point.
    - A good summary should take only a minute or two to read and cover main ideas only.

- Test for clarity:
    - Share your summary with someone unfamiliar with the topic.
    - Fresh readers help identify unclear or overly complex sections.

## Benefits of Text Summaries
- Help all users, not just those with disabilities.
    - Text summaries improve overall usability and comprehension.

- Support small-screen users:
    - Prevent excessive scrolling when viewing large charts or tables.

- Assist users with slow internet connections:
    - Provide essential information without needing to load heavy or interactive content.

- Accommodate different learning styles:
    - Visual learners benefit from charts and graphics.
    - Non-visual or verbal learners gain clarity from concise text explanations.
    
- Aid users in a hurry:
    - Enable quick skimming for main ideas and key takeaways.

- Support users new to the topic:
    - Simplify complex data or visual presentations into easier-to-understand summaries.
