# Accessible Multimedia on web

## Balancing creativity and accessibility

Modern web development allows for interactive and multimedia experiences (video, audio, animation).

Accessibility doesn’t mean limiting creativity. It means providing alternate ways for users to engage.

Developers should allow users to customize their experience (e.g., adjust motion, volume, or contrast).

A customizable experience is the most accessible experience since user needs vary.

## Benefits and inclusivity of multimedia

Multimedia (video/audio) can make content more engaging and accessible for:
- Users with visual or cognitive impairments (like dyslexia).
- Users who prefer visual or auditory learning styles.

However, for users who find multimedia less accessible, follow WCAG guidelines to ensure alternatives are available.

## Avoid autoplay
Autoplay is discouraged because it:
- Interferes with screen readers by overlapping sounds.
- Can be disorienting or frustrating for users.
- Causes hearing-impaired users to miss content if they don’t realize playback has started.

Modern browsers block unmuted autoplay anyway (Chromium only allows muted autoplay).

Exception: muted autoplay for visual media is acceptable under WCAG 1.4.2, provided:
- Users have controls to pause/stop audio, or
- Volume controls (separate from system controls) are provided.

**WCAG F93:** muted autoplay meets accessibility compliance.

## Captions and transcripts (WCAG 2.1 & related levels)

Non-text content (audio/video) must have text alternatives like captions or transcripts.

Captions: 
- Show synchronized text for video audio. 
Required for:
    - Prerecorded video → WCAG Level A
    - Live streaming video → WCAG Level AA

Transcripts: 
- Provide a full written version of audio content. 
Required for:
    - Prerecorded audio-only → Level A
    - Live audio-only → Level AAA
    - A written script can also meet AAA.

Avoid auto-generated captions: 
- Auto-generated text often includes errors and incorrect terms.
- Use them only as a starting point and human-review before publishing.

## Accessible Media Players

Basic requirements:
- Must have play, pause/stop controls.
- Must support keyboard navigation.
- Must have a visible focus indicator.
- Must meet minimum color contrast standards for text, buttons, and backgrounds.

HTML `<audio>` and `<video>` elements meet these requirements by default.

These considerations mainly apply when using custom-built or third-party players.

## Animations and Accessibility
WCAG SC 2.3.3: Motion-based animations must be toggleable off, unless essential to functionality.

Accessibility concerns:
- Can cause vertigo, dizziness, or nausea for some users.
- Can distract or confuse neurodiverse users (e.g., ADHD, cognitive disorders).
- Flashing animations (especially red, >3 flashes/sec) can trigger seizures — prohibited under WCAG SC 2.3.1.

The old `<blink>` tag was deprecated due to these concerns.

## prefers-reduced-motion Media Query
A CSS media query that detects if the user has set a system preference for reduced motion.

Developers can create alternate, low-motion experiences for such users.

Works like other media queries — does not automatically adjust animations, developers must define styles.

Example usage:
```bash
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation: none;
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

Other “prefers-” media queries (existing or in development):
- prefers-color-scheme (light/dark mode)
- prefers-contrast (increased contrast)
- prefers-reduced-transparency
- prefers-reduced-data
