## Color based accessibility issues
0. check if the page title is available for every page, and it is updating dynamically
1. Switch to greyscale and check color contrast and readability
2. Input fields, buttons, icons, and more all take up enough visual space
3. Check target size for CTAs
4. Take a look at how our layout adjusts when the orientation of the device is changed
5. Resize the screen width, zoom in to 200% and check how the screen looks like
6. Text sizes - if they are in px or relative units
7. Check if buttons and links are serving their correct purposes
