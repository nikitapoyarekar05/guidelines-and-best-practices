# Accessibility Audit

## Color based accessibility issues
1. Switch to greyscale and check color contrast and readability
2. Input fields, buttons, icons, and more all take up enough visual space
3. Check target size for CTAs
4. Take a look at how our layout adjusts when the orientation of the device is changed
5. Resize the screen width, zoom in to 200% and check how the screen looks like
6. Text sizes
